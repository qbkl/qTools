3. Upload the folder via FTP to your WordPress installation, by replacing the old _**qtools**_ folder, or just the contents of it with the contents of the new release's folder.

## Updating with GitHub Updater

**GitHub Updater** is a WordPress plugin created to help users easily update WordPress plugins that are hosted on GitHub and not on the WordPress plugin repository. **qTools** offers support for GitHub Updater via the plugin header information.

You can **download GitHub Updater** from here: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater

It's recommended that you Upgrade from the _Dashboard > Update_ menu rather than from _Plugins > Installed Plugins_.
After the upgrade, the plugin folder will receive a new name, based on the release ID which will cause the plugin to deactive. You will have to manually reactivate the plugin after updating it.

_**Note:**_ Upon deactivation / deletion, the qTools plugin does not delete plugin added data and settings.
